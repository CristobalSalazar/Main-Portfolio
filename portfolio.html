                Event io is a social media application that is based on user location. Think of it
                like a localized instagram. The purpose of event.io is to create a singular feed for
                an event in which users can post to and see what others are posting. The application
                allows users make friends and follow other's activity. users. The application was
                built using React Native and employs the same mapping and geocoding technology used
                by airbnb. The app uses web sockets to communicate in realtime and employs role
                based authentication to make sure that server routes, and feeds are protected based
                on the users role.

                well as compare companies with their peers to see how they relate with the
                competition. While making the app I employed a binary search algorithm to
                effectively sort through a list of 8000 tickers. You are also able to view news on
                the currently viewed company to gather even more information.

                Giffycat is a social media front-end application that allows users to like,

                project. It pulls data from the GIPHY API. The design of the app was inspired by
                Instagram's layout. The app was also built from the ground up with mobile devices in
                mind and as a result is very adaptive to different devices. The app was styled using
                sass and the main logic implements jQuery.

                Barb's Adventure is an isometric ARPG video game which is the result of combining
                Diablo chess. It is a mobile game made with the Unity Engine. I programmed
                everything from game logic, to shaders, and even did all the animations vfx, sfx,
                music and 3D modelling! Key features of Barb's Adventure include a dynamic
                procedural level generation system which increases in difficulty the further you
                travel. The game makes extensive use of the ASTAR algorithm in the enemy pathfinding
                and AI.

                Bitstream is an arcade inspired shoot 'em up (SHMUP). The game was programmed from
                the bottom up for mobile devices and makes use of the accelerometer for navigation.
                The game features many unlockable ships and different attacks. Like Barb's
                Adventure, I programmed everything in the game, and made all the pixel art,
                animations, music and sound effects. Bitstream uses themed levels to maintain
                consistency and appeal to the gamer, all whilst using controlled random generation
                to provide a different experience through each play through. Bitstream is available
                on both the iOS and Google Play Store and is monetized via in game ads.

                Pathfinding Algorithms is a console application that gives you a random seed of
                obstacles, and places the starting point at the bottom left of the map and an exit
                at the top right. You are then able to see how different algorithms solve the maze.
                The application was a result of research done on pathfinding algorithms. The
                application makes use of 3 different algorithms: ASTAR, Dijkstra, Greedy-Best First.
                You are also able to toggle diagonal movement.
